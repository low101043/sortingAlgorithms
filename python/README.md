# Python

This was the first Programming Language I learnt (used in GCSE and A Level Computer Science).  These algorithms were the ones I was taught in A Level and are not my own creation.  (However I have added documentation).  

## Credit
- Dr Hughes - A Level teacher who taught me these algorithms.  

## Running

- Linux
    - Have Python 3 installed
    ``` python main.py ```
