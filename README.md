# Sorting Algorithms
This project is a simple project which implements 4 of the major sorting algorithms in the programming languages which I know.

The Programming Languages shown are:
- Python
- Java
- C
- Haskell

The algorithms which will be/are implemented:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

These algorithms have been chosen as these are always taught and I have/can code these algorithms in the languages above. 

Each langauge each has its own small UI so you can 'use' them.
